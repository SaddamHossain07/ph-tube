        <p>var, let and const are the keywords of javaScript used for declaring a variable. let and const both are come
            with
            ES6. <br>
            The value of a variable declared with var and let can be updated. var can be re-assigned of re-declared also
            where let can not. The value will never be changed when the variable declared with const and never be
            re-declared. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Scope:</strong> In javaScript scope means where the variable are available to use. <br>
            <br>
            1. Scope of var : var is global and function scope. Global scope is when the variable declared outside of
            the
            function and can be used from anywhere, on the other hand function scope means the variable is declared
            inside
            of a function and can be used only inside of this function. <br> Note: var is hoisted to the top of it's
            scope
            and hold a value of undefined. <br><br>

            2. Scope of let and const : let and const both are block scope. Block scope is a part of code inside the
            curly
            braces {}. Everything inside curly braces is a block. when a variable declared inside this block, it can be
            used
            only inside of this block.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-8">use case of 'null' and 'undefined'</h3>
        <p><strong>null</strong><br>
            When a variable is assigned 'null' as the value, it returns an object with no value, it means the value is
            empty
            or blank.
            Null is a privitive type of data in javaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>undefined</strong><br>
            1. When we declared a variable but not assigned any value yet, javaScript set a value and it returns
            undefined.
            <br>
            2. while calling a function without passing any arguments for the parameters, parameters set the value as
            'undefined'. When a function does not return any value, it returns 'undefined'.

        <p>REST means Representational State Transfer and API means Application Programming Interface, in short REST API
            or
            RESTful API. <br>
            REST API is a set of architectural principles or style for designing and interacting with web service. The
            REST
            API communicate the client with the database, while performing it is ensured the security, control and
            authentication. When a client request is made via RESTful API, it delivered the data in JSON or other
            format.
